When printing both self-making and existing 3D models, users often create models to fit to a real object within it. Fitting models to the size of a real object is a delicate problem. To address it, we present a concept to capture the size of a real object, create or modify a model that conforms to the captured image, and print the model on the spot. We create a 3D printer to realize this concept by installing a touch panel display in the build plate system. In this paper, we focus on creating containers that fit accessories. We create containers for a pair of scissors, a smart watch, a drone, a pair of glasses, and a pen holder.
